In Question No.1 -  This Python program serves as a basic calculator, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts users to select an operation from a menu and input two numbers. Based on the chosen operation, it computes the result and displays it. However, the program lacks error handling for potential issues like division by zero or invalid input. By incorporating error handling, it could provide a more robust user experience, ensuring accurate calculations and informative feedback in case of errors.

In Question No.2 - This Python program calculates the grades for a student based on the percentage obtained in four different subjects. It prompts the user to input the marks obtained in each subject out of 100. Then, it calculates the average percentage across all four subjects. Using the provided grading scheme, the program determines the corresponding grade for the student. Grades range from A+ for percentages of 80% and above, down to Fail for percentages below 40%. The program provides a concise summary of the student's performance based on their calculated average percentage and assigns the appropriate grade accordingly.

In Question No.3 - This Python program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. It continuously provides feedback to the user based on their guess, informing them whether their guess is too high or too low. The program counts the number of attempts it takes for the user to guess the correct number. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program congratulates them and displays the total number of attempts made. The program effectively engages the user in a guessing game while providing them with feedback to guide their subsequent guesses, ultimately culminating in the successful revelation of the randomly generated number.
